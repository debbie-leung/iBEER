```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Set up
```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

data <- read.csv("physiology_mastersheet.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

### Exploratory Figures

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
